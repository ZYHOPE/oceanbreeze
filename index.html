    <h1>Come Sit Down and Enjoy the Sea Breeze with Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Come sit down and enjoy the sea with me.
         Feel the salt air flow through your curly hair,
         gaze into the ocean with eyes as blue as the sea itself. Sit
         by me and enjoy and we can talk about life, love, your fears or
         joke around and laugh for hours. And when its storming and you're scared, I'll hug 
         you tight and protect you from the crashing waves. If I was to write about 
         how much I love you the words would fill the sea it self so come
         jump in and sink deep into the depths og my heart and feel it beat for you.
    </p>
